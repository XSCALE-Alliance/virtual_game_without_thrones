This is a fork from the Minetest Game available at:
	https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game

This game is modified to play XSCALE's "Game Without Thrones",
a game to teach Agile Organization 
with no command and control, no hierarchy, no managers, masters or owners. 
But chapter meetings, governance treaties, small councils, 
Leadership as a Service, self-managing streams of self-organizing teams, 
and the wit and wisdom of Wildlings ...

Below follows the original Minetest Game documentation:

Minetest Game [minetest_game]
=============================
The main game for the Minetest engine
=====================================

To use this game with the Minetest engine, insert this repository as
	/games/minetest_game

The Minetest engine can be found in:
	https://github.com/minetest/minetest/

Compatibility
--------------
The Minetest Game github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of the Minetest engine.

Additionally, when the Minetest engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.10), Minetest Game is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, Minetest Game is packaged and made available in
	http://minetest.net/downloads/
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository. (Package maintainers please note!)
